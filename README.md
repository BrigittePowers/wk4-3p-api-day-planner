The goal of this project was to create a daily planner utilizing jquery, moment.js, boostrap and other third party APIs. The planner tracks time using moment.js and updates the input field colors accordingly to allow the user to track the day. The user can save tasks in assigned hourly text fields and have that data pull back up from local storage upon page reload. 

A live demo of the website can be viewed at: https://brigittepowers.github.io/wk5-3p-api-day-planner/

Attached is a photo of how the site should appear upon initial load.
